2. It looks like several small spruce trees were planted in the back yard. Sadly, by the time we closed they all appear to be dead. Will the builder be replacing these in the spring?
3. The grout between the fireplace tile and wall is cracked and separating.
4. There are caulking cracks in door and window trim throughout. Some examples are attached.
5. The drywall by the top of the beam on the living room side has a ripple in it. This is prioritized as high because it is difficult to determine if it is just an aberration or water damage.
6. The water often makes a loud buzzing noise. Is that normal?
7. The furnace makes a loud BANG! when it turns on or off. That can't be normal.

3. Screen doors are binding and not in track correctly.  They do not close all the way.  
4. Handle on right side of double slider doors is loose.  Screws have been tightened many times but the handle comes loose after use.
5. The exterior light fixture hung between the two man-doors on the garage is hung at a low height, making it a hazard for the Waste Management employee. Homeowner prefers a standard, small fixture.
6. Master bath shower RAINHEAD was a special upgraded fixture.  What we requested and showed a photo of to our design consultant, Sarah Beth, is not what we got .

DP12-Johanneson,Landed Gentry - Mary,Misc. warranty repairs,18,,"1. We called us out to Mary right after move-in that there was a pretty significant stain or blemish on the hardwood floors that you can see as you enter into the great room. 
Not sure if that came from glue from above the beam or stain, but it’s very visible when the light shines on it..
2. Before moved in, we called out. The driveway is not being in great condition. I know they tried to power wash to get rid of some of the stains, but they still exist. Also chunks of cement have come off near garage slab, cleanup would be nice. Large scars and scabs across the asphalt, including a piece of wood embedded. In general, the driveway looks pretty crappy. Would prefer new asphalt or at minimum to have it cleaned up and sealed. ?
3. Dead trees or shrubs need to be replaced. 
4. There are a few sprinklers that are not reaching areas the grass that we’d like them evaluated. Also, it’s the middle of July super dry and we have areas of mud near our back patio. There is a lot of moisture almost feels a bit like quicksand when you walk on it. ? do you want to make sure that there’s not a leak. Throughout the property, there are areas of extreme dry versus extreme wet.
5. We must replace 10 lightbulbs since we’ve been in the house for four weeks. Every time we came to the house while it was being built, we noticed the lights were on. We assumed all the lightbulbs would be replaced before we moved in. Clearly that’s not the case and now some of the ? high ceiling voltage lights have burnt out. We would like to have all new lightbulbs so that we know they will last us for a few years as they should.
6. Underneath siding (wood) is visible), electrical box and a few outside areas. The left and rear side of the exterior house needs a lot of touchups or even repaint . In particular, the exterior garage door has several issues with it screw stripped does not latch and weatherstrip is disconnect. 
7. Unpainted nail next to garage front house.
8. Both the large and small doors need to be repainted. Chunks of paint have peeled off.
9. I’ve had a few people mentioned to me that they noticed the lock on the front door isn’t at a straight angle. Once you see it, you always see it. I realize this is Minor and not super visible but if it’s easy to fix, I’d like it straightened.
10. There are a few places that need touchup. I believe we can also do this, but we don’t have our paint kit yet.
11. We’ve noticed several thin scratches on many of the windows, which is disappointing since they are brand new. Would like to understand what can be done. It’s difficult to capture on photo.
12. This wasn’t fully fixed during the initial walk-through when I tried to open the oven door. It’s still rubs against the quartz counter.
13. Scratches on the millwork - kitchen cabinet.
14. Back left slider - Door missing something.
15. Both back sliding glass door screens, which were installed after the initial walk-through both have holes in them. I need to be replaced..
16. Grout needs to be reapplied to the primary bathroom shower floor
17. Dent in garage door.
18. Had garage doors repainted due to incorrect product applied/peeling of paint. You can still see areas of the old paint, but the main concern is the doors are still sticking and not door not fully functioning correctly.
19. The toilet in the guest bathroom has been having some issues flushing, since the septic grinder got connected. After I plunged it, it does flash, but it’s happened twice. Just noting it here if it continues to happen, we may need to have someone check out that toilet.

2. The ceiling fans in the great room and master bedroom both react to both remotes.  One of the fans needs to be switched to a different frequency.  Also, the master bedroom fan will sometimes come on unexpectedly.  We think this may be related to the three way switch set up for the fan.  Please disable the switch next to the bathroom and replace the switch at the bedroom entrance with a standard switch.
3. The irrigation system was not annotated with the irrigation zones.  I am unable to determine the location of the drip zones.  Please identify location versus zone number.

14. Garbage shed exterior door has hole from opening into pipe
15. A few drawer pulls in the kitchen are not level
16. Plans show masonry on this surface. Why/when did it change to wood siding
17. Grout is uneven and has holes in various spots as noted by contractor that provided a quote for sealing. Said this would need to be taken care of first.
18. Insurance company flagged the installation of plants off the front porch as being too close (<5ft) from the house. Replace with river rock and larger rock?
19. The garage floor is pretty high in the middle and slopes in 4 directions. Is this correct/normal?
20. The heaters appear to be angled down too much and need to be adjusted up to about 45 degrees. They also appear to be a little underpowered, but this may be related to the installation angle. Please review.
21. The ethernet cables coming into/out of the panel in the laundry closet are not terminated or at least labeled. Atlas didn't have the tools or time to figure it out when they di dthe internet install.
22. Ethernet jacks are a mixture of CAT6 and Cat5e. I think they're all supposed to be CAT6
23. Rodents have been entering the crawlspace through at least 3 damaged ventilation screens in the foundation and around gaps in the dryer vent. One screen has an attempted repair without actually fastening it to the frame. All screens should probably be evaluated. Note that mice are also entering through the gap in the garage door mentioned elsewhere.",,6/20/2025,,,,60 Day,
DP5 - Kahler,Landed Gentry - Mary,HVAC/plumbing/flooring,32,,"1. Unfortunately the mstr bedroom/bathroom is not heating properly since adjustments were made last week.  It was too hot now it’s too cold.  It’s 5 degrees colder than the rest of the house.  I don’t know if the humming sound I reported on Friday has anything to do with it.  We do not feel any air flowing from the one and only heat register in that bedroom.  That’s where the humming sound is coming from also.  
2. After the cartridge was replaced in MBR shower faucet (Hansgrohe) due to the hot/cold water not mixing, the problem is now that we cannot get COLD water.  It will only get comfortably room temperature.  I contacted customer service today and was told the temperature can be adjusted by getting inside the faucet.  He said a plumber should do it and there are instructions on how to do it.  We need cold water occasionally.
3. There is a new humming noise coming from the ceiling area in the master bdrm when the furnace is ON and heating but not when the fan only is running.  It started the morning after the service call on Wednesday.  It can’t be heard anywhere else in the house. It sounds similar to a balloon letting air out with a pinched opening.  
4. Wood floor board in kitchen coming up (unglued) making an uneven walking surface.  ",,4/13/2025,,,,Other,

Lg Door--Yesterday door was making very weird noise when operating.  Light was randomly on and off.    Continued today.   Small door operating fine.

5:00 tonight--Lg door was randomly up and light on.  Door would not close.  I tried to release door to close door for evening.  Door will not close manually.  There seems to be tension.  Lights work on both small and large door.

7:00 tonight-- Nothing works... no doors, no lights on either door.  I Checked for tripped breaker or GECI.... all are fine.  Power in garage is working as well.

This is an emergency as I would rather not leave my garage door open a second night.  I am available ANYTIME on Friday if you can possibly send someone over.  Feel free to text me at 847-942-3624.  ",,11/13/2025,,,11/18/2025,"Service Completed (closed)

National Door went out on 6/24. They provided this feedback- The tech made some minor adjustments to the door. However, there is an issue with paint on the vinyl seal around the garage door. This paint sticks to the door and essentially seals the door shut which is making a “popping” sound when the door is first opened as its “breaking” the seal. The vinyl on this door should be replaced – this would not be a warranty to us as we do not paint. I would be a paid service. Our service call is $149+tax and the vinyl is $96+tax.

6/30- Emailed Greg and Catrina asking for a VPO for this. 
As of 8/13- no response from either Greg or Catrina.
Greg responded 8/13 with this- Catrina, replacement of the vinyl weather strip is the best solution. (No response from Catrina)
8/29- I reached out again asking for a VPO.
9/10- reached out again.
10/9- tried contacting Greg and Catrina again with no response.
Notified Kevin in early November about all of the open claims for Village Life & that they are unresponsive to several issues.
11/6- Kevin sent an email to Robert at Village Life, asking for assistance with the open claims. 
11/12- Kevin sent another email to Robert.
11/12- Greg responded to the email thread and told us he would respond about each item in the email in a week.
11/24- I haven't heard back from anyone at Village Life, so I sent another email.
11/24- Robert sent this- Thank you for checking in, we had some unexpected circumstance arise and have fallen behind.  I anticipate having an update for you mid next week. 
12/2- sent another email to Greg, Robert and Catrina.

Homeowner has sent several comments about their garage door tripping and having issues. They are very upset that this is taking so long to address.

BC6-Tripathi,,6. WHOLE HOUSE FAN(S),9,,"3.6 There were 2 problematic conditions detected in the laundry room at the time of this inspection - see attached video for a
detailed description. They are as follows:
#1. A whole house fan has been installed in this room with a solid door. Air from the whole house cannot enter this room. The
existing gap under the door is not large enough to allow enough air from the rest of the home into this room. This keeps the fan
from performing its intended function/maintain peak performance.
#2. The dryer is less effifficient without adequate make-up room air of which this vent will provide.
Recommend the builder to install a permanent natural draft vent above laundry room door as this has been a standard
construction practice for 20+ years. This allows the whole house fan to perform its intended function in providing whole house
ventilation and improves dryer effifficiency.",,1/2/2026,,,,New!,
BC6-Tripathi,,5. VENTILATION,8,,"Ventilation to the attic space is currently minimal. The only ventilation provisions are smart vents at the East/West sides and a Ridge vent. This might make up an accumulative total of 5 ft.² of natural draft ventilation into the attic which is very minimal. At least one square foot of ventilation is recommended for every 100-150 ft.² of attic space. Note that there is approximately 1250 ft.² of attic space which means
that there should be at least 10 ft.² of natural draft attic ventilation – see attached video for a detailed description. In addition, I conducted an inspection to the home due north of this property. The exact same ventilation provisions exist to that attic.Mold was discovered in the attic of the property due north.
I suspect that mold will result in your attic space if the builder does not improve attic ventilation;
Recommend the builder to have a licensed and bonded electrical contractor/roofifing contractor to install a high CFM output attic fan on a humidistat/thermostat in the attic space. This will require cutting out a square rooftop vent, mounting the attic fan at the underside of the vent, running electrical (inspected/approved and permitted through the city of Bothell) to the fan.",,1/2/2026,,,,New!,
BC6-Tripathi,,4. DRAINAGE PROVISIONS or 'LACK THEREOF',7,,"2.11
NO DRAINAGE AT ALL ON THE PROPERTY TO HELP PREVENT PONDING STORM WATER?
There is no visible evidence of drainage provisions at the East side of home or at the North/N.E. corner areas (home sits at a low
point of the hillside). Retaining walls create a 'Well Effffect' and will trap/pool storm water. There is evidence of standing water at
this location due to absent drainage. Note that ponding water within 10' feet of the rear patio/foundation is conducive to water
penetration in the substructure, undermining of the foundation wall(s)/footing(s)/patio and potential structural movement – see
attached video for a detailed description.
NOTE:Most builder provided warranties describe a drainage problem as: 'STANDING WATER WITHIN 10' FEET OF THE
FOUNDATION FOR 72 HOURS OR MORE'. It seems that the existing conditions meets the criteria of that description;
Recommend the builder to have a licensed drainage contractor
to install drainage provisions/surface drain(s) tied in with drain
tile at this area to prevent future conditions. Slope the grade
toward the surface drains.",,1/2/2026,,,,New!,
BC6-Tripathi,,3. PLUMBING STACKS/ STORM BOOTS,6,,1.8 The plumbing boot flanges are loose/lifting at the East vent stack; Recommend the builder to secure loose/lifted flflanges to prevent wind driven rain penetration/roof leakage.,,1/2/2026,,,,New!,
BC6-Tripathi,,1. GUTTERS/ DOWN SPOUTS/ DRAINAGE,5,,"1.4 (1) All 3 of the front second story down spouts and one at the rear discharge on the lower roof(s) - see attached video for a
detailed description. Concentrated storm water discharge is conducive to accelerated granule loss and premature roof failure;
Recommend the builder to have the roofifing contractor to extend the downspouts to discharge directly into the lower gutter(s)
to prevent accelerated decay/premature failure.

1.4 (2) Front gutter above garage is pitched incorrectly at the West end and pooling water. This is conducive to overflflow, leakage
and can weigh the gutter down resulting in detachment. Uncontrolled storm water and faulty sloped gutters can result in other
problematic conditions long-term; Recommend the builder to rehang gutter to drain correctly toward downspout to prevent
future conditions.

Shortly after move-in, water from the shower regularly entered the closet area and leaked down to the level below. The builder previously addressed this by installing shower door guards and patching a hole in the door frame with silicone. An industrial dehumidifier was also run in the closet for approximately one week. While the active downstairs leak appears to have been resolved. The whole closet now reeks of mold. 

Additionally the shower drain is tiled in and so cannot be self services for clogs. It regularly drains slow which increases the odds of leakage into the closet.

7721-Holloway,,Leaking Basement Sewer Cleanouts,4,,"We wanted to make you aware of an issue we encountered today with one of the three basement sewer cleanouts.

We contacted a licensed plumber to assess a sewer leak observed at one cleanout. During the visit, the plumber noted that all three basement cleanouts have caps installed in a reversed orientation, and that the nipple portions of the caps are pierced, which allows sewer water to escape into the basement.

As part of the assessment, the plumber also scoped the sewer line and confirmed that it is clear and functioning as intended. Based on this, the issue appears to be related to the cleanout assemblies themselves rather than any blockage or homeowner use.

The plumber did not proceed with repairs, as the appropriate replacement parts were not available and this appears to fall under the home warranty.
Given the nature of a sewer leak, we would appreciate this being addressed as soon as possible. Please let us know when your team can come out to properly reinstall or replace all three cleanouts so they are secure and no longer at risk of leaking.

We also wanted to flag that today’s plumbing service call, which was necessary to diagnose the issue, was approximately $700, and we would appreciate confirmation that this cost will be covered as part of the warranty process.

Thank you for your attention to this, and please let us know next steps and timing.

He mentioned that, if we’re concerned about the live wire, an easier solution would be to install toe-kick LED lights under the sink and reroute the wire there, rather than opening the ceiling to locate it.
We are concerned about the live wire not being connected to anything — can we move forward with the electrician’s recommendation to install toe-kick LED lights under the sink?",,12/4/2025,,,,New!,

TC17 - Foster,,Improper Drainage in yard,1,,"There are currently multiple areas in the yard where the ground is very saturated and just by walking on it your foot will become submerged in dirt. With multiple spots of standing water, even a day after it has stopped raining. It seems as if the French drain on the north side of the house does not work properly as there is constantly standing water. On the far west side of the lawn is also very saturated with water. The south side is also very saturated all along the foundation. 

South side: seems as if water is not draining through the dirt that is below the gravel. All along the foundation anything bearing weight will sink into the ground. Also along the backyard patio is the same issue, worried about foundation issues long term. 

West side of lawn: along the west perimeter of the lawn is all saturated. Causing the grass to slowly die. Worried about potential long term issues with the retaining wall. 

North side: the entire north side of the yard is a marsh pit. It seems as if the French drain is barely working even after cleaning around it. All along the retaining wall the ground compresses when stepped on. Very worried about issues with the retaining wall. And there is major standing water. 

Front yard: due to the issues in the side yards, the front yard is also having saturation issues. 

We are wanting to remedy these issues. It is not allowing us to put up sheds as we are worried about it sinking into the ground.

#1. A whole house fan has been installed in this room with a solid door. Air from the whole house (rooms outside the laundry room) cannot enter this room. The existing gap under the door is not large enough to allow enough air from the rest of the home into this room. This keeps the fan from performing its intended function.

#2. The laundry room is an unconditioned space, no heat source currently.

#3. The dryer is less efficient without adequate make-up room air of which this vent will provide.

The builder should install a permanent natural draft vent above laundry room door as this is a very common practice in most of today's new construction and has been for the last 20+ years. This vent helps supply warm air from the condition space to the unconditioned space.

DP5 - Kahler,,Thermador Fridge/Hood Vent,40,,"This is a separate email regarding an item that is not fully addressed in the Inspection list of warranty items.
DeWaard Bode installer is in my home today replacing the damaged Thermador hood vent.  I assume there will be no further issues once the new one is installed.  Installer is also able to remove a large amount of drywall dust accumulated inside the electrical unit which was due to drywall installation above the hood after the hood was installed.  

The Thermador refigerator has problems regarding the door/drawers and panels.  Also non working interior cameras that are currently being addressed with Thermador directly.  They are sending an authorized service technician in 2 weeks to replace the wiring and cameras.  The issue with the cameras is due to the swapping of the door hinges from right to left.    So this is a wait and see.  I have been dealing directly with Thermador since last October after the DeWaard Bode installer did all he could to troubleshoot the issue to no avail.

The LG warranty issues for the refrigerator are as follows

1.  Unfinished exposed plywood on the underneath side of cabinet above fridge that should be finished cabinetry.   A New matching finished cabinet panel is needed to replace the exposed plywood.
2.  Refrigerator door cabinet panel rubs against drawer panel below not allowing both to be open at the same time.   Trevor the installer is here from DeWaard Bode and says he can adjust the panel so it won't rub.  That will take care of this problem assuming he is successful.
3. The bottom freezer drawer is difficult to open because the drawer handle was installed too low, however it should have been installed near the top of the drawer.  It is difficult to open with this low position of the handle without causing me lower back pain.    Thermador shows this freezer drawer handle near the top of the drawer.  I am happy to send you pics if needed.  DeWaard Bode installer has told me he can replace the panels once new panels are ordered for the top of fridge cabinet and freezer drawer to match existing. The freezer door will need a new panel, not a hole filled in the current one.   If you have any questions about this item please contact the installer Trevor from DB.  Thank you

DP5 - Kahler,,Addendum to Electrical warranty issues,35,,"Subject: Addendum to Electrical Warranty Items

Please consider this an addendum to the existing list of electrical warranty items for your records.

We have experienced multiple electrical issues in our home, both past and ongoing. Most recently, the non-functioning fireplace switch in the living room was addressed and resolved by the fireplace company.  
Last fall a faulty GFI outlet in the garage tripped the breaker. This incident affected seven outlets after an appliance was plugged in. This occurred shortly after we moved in and at the time, MCE was working at a neighboring property, and I asked their electrician to take a look. Initially, he was unsure of the cause but ultimately determined the GFI outlet was defective and replaced it.

Given this and the other electrical concerns we’ve encountered, we are increasingly concerned that there may be a broader, systemic electrical issue within the home.",,7/16/2025,,,,New!,

17606-Riddell,,Added to claim 0002,4,,"While configuring our home internet network I tested several of the house-wired Ethernet outlets with a handheld RJ-45 cable-continuity tester (the kind with a MASTER and REMOTE unit that lights an LED for each of the eight pins).

How I tested:
Plugged the MASTER unit into one of the cat5 cables in the master bedroom closet networking panel
Plugged the REMOTE unit into the matching wall jack in each room.
Watched the LEDs cycle 1 ? 8.
• If all eight pins are connected, every LED lights in sequence.
• If a pin is open, its LED never lights.

I first confirmed the tester on a spare patch cable (all eight LEDs lit), then checked four wall jacks:
- One of the wall jacks correctly has all eight pins connected, and the wired internet connection behaves as expected. 
- For each of the other 3 tested, one of the pins was not connected (pin #3 for one, pin #5 for another, etc). When even one pin is open, the drop cannot provide a fully functional Ethernet connection.  

Because multiple drops are mis-terminated, I’d like you to send someone to:
1. Test every Ethernet run with an eight-pin RJ-45 continuity tester (T-568B wiring).
2. Re-terminate both ends of any run that fails, so every outlet operates correctly, then test the run again and confirm that all eight pins are connected.

One more thing we discovered.  Now that Spring has arrived and we're getting outside, we've been out enough to notice the following: 

1.  All around the house, there are a lot of roofing nails that are present and unsightly,  sticking they and out at rafters, soffit vents, and facia areas that should be cut off, puddied and repainted.  

2.   Same locations around the house outside, there are a couple of places where the fascia boards are in very bad condition and need repair.  It looks like poor quality wood or some sort of damage occurred initially.  We're thinking some sanding, puddy, and repainting is needed.

Shelter 3934B  - Jimenez,HD Partners,Plumbing emergency - Repairs requested,7,,"Good afternoon, 

I am writing to inform you about an emergency plumbing situation at 3934 B South Pearl St, Seattle, WA 98118, as well as to request compensation and repairs consistent with the agreement outlined in the Builder's Limited Warranty.

At approximately 6pm on Wednesday 9/25/2024, we discovered that the bathtub in the downstairs bathroom was filling with sewage. To avoid it overflowing and causing damage to other parts of the house, we called an emergency plumber from Bee's Plumbing and Heating. Upon arrival, the plumber stated that the mainline was backing up. To fix this problem, they attempted to snake the mainline and in doing so observed that the backwater valve was stuck shut - meaning that water was not able to flow from the house to the main sewer line. As they noted (see attached), this backwater valve was faulty and needs to be replaced. The plumber removed this valve so that water is able to flow from the house to the sewer. This valve is no longer functioning and, as a result, backwater is now potentially able to cause flooding. 

Yesterday's repairs cost $1,981.06, which we paid out of pocket. We are seeking reimbursement for this cost given that this problem falls under Section B Coverage (which lasts 2 years - and we are within this period), specifically I. Mechanical systems, 1. Plumbing, water supply, and septic systems, f. stopped up sewers, fixtures, and drains. As stated in the Builder's Limited Warranty document (Section VI, C), the homeowner should not make any voluntary payments without written approval of the builder. However, our out-of-pocket expenses fall under the exception written in the same section which states that these expenses may be paid without written approval in making repairs in an emergency condition, provided that (1) these repairs are solely for the protection of the home from further damage, (2) we notify the builder of these repairs within 5 days, and (3) we provide the builder with an accurate written record of the repair costs (see attached for PDF of the repair costs). Our situation meets all of these requirements. 

Additionally, we request that the builder repair, or provide compensation for repair, the backwater valve. Bee’s Plumbing and Heating quoted these repairs at $6,038.15. Please see attached for a PDF of this quote. 

As backwater valves are required by the City of Seattle, it is vital that this is repaired immediately. After submitting this written documentation, I will attempt to call the builder requesting repairs. I am able to be reached by phone at (505)550-5387 or by email at tjjflc@gmail.com. 

Attached are the required documents, including the costs of yesterday’s repairs and the quoted cost for the backwater valve repairs. 

Thank you,
Tyler Jimenez

Lifting boards are due to lack of expansion space. Hardwood is a natural product, and color will change over time, the finish topcoat is still in place. These issues are covered under warranty. W
Manufacturing Related Issues Observed: Planks with heavier discoloration could be witnessed. However, the top coat was still in place and could be seen with even gloss in these areas.
Site Related Issues Observed: Lack of consistent 1/16"" expansion space at base and trims.
Performance Related Issues Observed: No sign of delamination that was reported, could be found.

I was asked to take moisture readings of the master shower tile. Homeowner concerned water is still trapped behind the tile seat area and outside the glass. Readings borderline on the outside where water had been seeping out due to the new seal. Apparently, the homeowner says the sub noticed there was no original seal at the tile and glass. 
Lower readings inside the shower at the bench. There doesn't appear to be any real issues with moisture. Readings between 22-40%. Please review all the pictures.  Russ",2/24/2024,5/24/2024,"Accents and Interiors: Fri, May 24, 2024 8:00AM - 12:00PM,

567-Liu,,Plumbing issue at 567 NE 90th St.,1,,"Last Friday (12/6), the toilet on the first floor of my house became completely clogged. Prior to the clogging, the toilet had been gurgling intensely. A similar issue occurred about two weeks ago but resolved itself within a few hours. Unfortunately, this time, the clog persisted, and using a plunger had no effect.

I contacted Beacon Plumbing on Friday evening, and they suggested that the problem might be due to a backed-up mainline requiring specialized equipment to clear, with an estimated cost of $805. I paid $82.76 for the trip charge but decided to seek a second opinion from another plumbing company.

On Saturday (12/7), Pioneer Plumbing inspected the issue and identified the cause as a problem with the backwater valve for the sewer line. An additional flap at the bottom of the valve body was causing toilet paper to accumulate. The plumber removed the extra flap piece and reinstalled the flap assembly. The total cost for their service was $461.21.",This has been resolved. ,12/13/2024,,,,Non-Warranty,

My new home was closed on September 30, 2024, and within less than 60 days, I am already facing sewer drain clogging issues caused by gravel inside the pipeline. This has been an extremely unpleasant experience, and I have not received adequate support from the builder to resolve the problem.

Here is a timeline of the events:

November 20, 2024: Water backed up in the first-floor bathroom, which I had to clean.
November 21, 2024: Cascade Builder Service scheduled a plumber to inspect the issue. The plumber determined the problem was in the main sewer line outside the property and mentioned escalating the matter to their manager for the next steps.
November 21, 2024: The water backup occurred again in the first-floor bathroom.
November 22, 2024: I hired a plumber to address the clog temporarily. The builder later sent someone to confirm that the gravel in the pipeline was the root cause.

I have had to take several days off work to deal with this issue, and I am deeply frustrated by the lack of updates or resolution from the builder. The pipeline remains partially obstructed, and another water backup could happen at any time.

I am requesting immediate assistance to resolve this issue with high priority. Please provide an update on the next steps as soon as possible.

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to inquire about the warranty of the air conditioning unit installed in our house, which we closed on December 15, 2022. The AC was barely used last summer and is now blowing only wind without cooling.

On July 19th, a technician from Bob's Heating inspected the unit and found it low on refrigerant, which they refilled. The technician also put a diagnosis kit inside to locate the leaking spot. He also mentioned that such a new unit should not have a leak and recommended checking the warranty and repair coverage.

Could you please confirm the warranty duration for the AC unit and whether the repair cost can be covered once the leak is located?

Thank you for your assistance.

WP61 - Porter,,SANCO2 Water Heater Replacement,22,,"Per message sent to homeowner on 7/11/24, this reimbursement request has been declined under warranty.  This claim was submitted after the one year warranty expiration date and, also, the warranty provisions don't allow for homeowners to make repairs on their own and request reimbursement.

On 3/29/24 I had my leaking SANCO2 Water Heater (see picture) replaced by a natural gas tankless water heater.  DeJong Heating did the work (see invoice), replacing the old heat pump water heater with a Navien NP-210A2 97% tankless natural gas water heater.  The total came to $6,032.58.  I did some research and found that the company that made the SANCO2 water heater is no longer doing business in the United States and relocated to Australia, though I see some third-party businesses still trying to sell this defective product online.  Also, my one-year warranty period did not end till June 8, 2014, so my claim is well within the warranty period.

In addition, over a dozen of my Woods Point neighbors have had to replace their SANCO2 for the same reason at their own expense. Unfortunately, for many of them, their tanks started to leak just a short time after their (1) warranty expired.

I am asking for some type of reimbursement for the costs I incurred.  Had Landed Gentry offered to repair the old heater or replace it with the same thing, I definitely would have rejected that offer.  I would ask that you give serious consideration to my claim as you will probably receive similar ones from other Woods Point residents that had to deal with the same problem.  

Thank you.

CB1-12 - Jameson,,Insufficient System,7,,"We've been thinking about this HVAC situation a lot lately.  We are not happy with the system.   We realize the unit is going to be replaced, but we are concerned about the overall set-up.  We have been advised by two HVAC people that (1) it is on the wrong wall to function properly.  We've been told splits should be on a wall with a window.  It was explained to us why.   (2) How is this single unit supposed to cool more than just the living area?  We've already noticed the difference between living and bedroom areas.  We feel like this system is insufficient to cool the entire home, which is what we and any buyer we'd think, should be able to expect.   A multi port system has been suggested to us and we're hoping this can be upgraded to properly cool the entire home.  While this broken unit is being replaced soon, might be a good time to re-evaluate the entire set-up.  We hope you'll consider this.  Please advise.
