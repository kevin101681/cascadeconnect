fix: Calendar hooks error (render more hooks than previous)

Problem:
React error when clicking closing date: 'Rendered more hooks than during the previous render'

Root Cause:
Calendar component was calling useState inside conditional render - this violates React's Rules of Hooks (hooks must be called at the top level and cannot be called inside conditionals).

Solution:
Move calendar state to component top level.

Changes:

HomeownerCard.tsx:
- Add viewYear/viewMonth state at top level
- Initialize from editClosingDate or current date
- Remove useState calls from inside calendar dropdown
- Add useEffect to sync calendar view when picker opens

AdminMobile.tsx:
- Add calendarViewYear/calendarViewMonth state at top level
- Remove React.useState calls from inside calendar dropdown
- Add useEffect to sync calendar view when picker opens

Benefits:
- No more hooks violation error
- Calendar view remembers position between toggles
- Opens to correct month when date already selected
- Follows React best practices

Verification:
- npm run build successful
- No TypeScript errors
- Calendar opens without error
