# Netlify redirects for Single Page Application (SPA)
# This ensures all routes are handled by index.html for client-side routing
# BUT exclude static assets and API routes from the redirect
#
# Note: Redirects in this file are processed BEFORE netlify.toml redirects
# So we must handle API routes here directly, or they'll be caught by the catch-all
#
# Order matters: more specific patterns must come before the catch-all

# Exclude static assets from SPA redirect
/assets/*    /assets/:splat   200

# Handle API routes - redirect directly to Netlify Functions
# This prevents the catch-all from matching these routes
# Note: Netlify Functions are accessed via /.netlify/functions/function-name
# Using wildcard pattern to match all /api/cbsbooks/* routes
